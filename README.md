Multidimensional responses of grassland stability to eutrophication 

better run codes in the following orders 
1. combinations of climate extremes and illustration for questions investigated.r
2. categorize climate extremes and calculate stability facets.r
3. robustness test_using 22 sites with at least 10 years of experiments
4. robustness test_stability facets after detrending spei
5. robustness test_stability for Hill numbers with different Q.r
6.
